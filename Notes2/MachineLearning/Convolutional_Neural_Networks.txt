====== Convolutional Neural Networks ======
Created Saturday 02 August 2025

= Neurons are locally connected, not to every single neuron in the same layer (safes computing time)


=== Typical CNN flow: ===

Input image or molecule (e.g., 32x32 pixels or 3D grid)
↓
Convolution Layer (learns patterns)
↓
ReLU activation (adds non-linearity)
↓
Pooling Layer (compresses info)
↓
Another Conv + Pool (deeper features)
↓
Flatten
↓
Fully Connected Layers
↓
Output (e.g., class probabilities)

--------------------

=== Convolution Layer ===
→ Relevant for Ashvini 1 by recognizing functional groups in molecules or predict interactions with biological systems (like danger for fish liver etc.)

→ Convolutions automatically learn local patterns & use fewer patterns
→ applies filters (small matrices) to an input to extract features (like edges and shapes in images for example)
→ for images: Small stencil "scans" the image and scales it down

--------------------

=== Pooling Layer ===
= reducing the convolution layer into smaller, simplified samples (subsampling)
→ focus on high-level abstractions
→ compressing information in order to save computation power and avoid overfitting
→ Average, max-level etc... many information reduction mechanisms are possible
