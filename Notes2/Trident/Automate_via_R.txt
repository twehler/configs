====== Automate via R ======
Created Tuesday 15 July 2025

After installation, we want to use Trident via web-scraping, because no API has been exposed (at the moment of creating this test). 
Required packages: RSelenium, rvest, wdman

Problem: Paywall with Firefox, because rsDriver() tries to download PhantomJS, triggering a 402 Payment Required error.

===== Using Firefox with RSelenium and Docker: =====

**First, let's set up Selenium server (which then allows the R Script to control Firefox in an automated way):**
sudo docker pull selenium/standalone-firefox:3.141.59-20210913
sudo docker run -d -p 4445:4444 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-firefox:3.141.59-20210913

-p 4445:4444	- 	Forwards port 4444 inside the container to your local port 4445
-v /dev/shm:/dev/shm	-	Fixes memory problems with browser rendering
selenium/standalone-firefox	-	This image includes: Firefox + Geckodriver + Selenium server

**Test it:** 
curl http://localhost:4445/wd/hub/status 
(should return contents of JSON script)

===== In R: =====
remDr <- remoteDriver(
  remoteServerAddr = "localhost",
  port = 4445L,
  browserName = "firefox",
  version = "latest",
  extraCapabilities = list(seamless = TRUE),
)
remDr$open()

**In this example, Trident uses port 8501**
remDr$navigate("localhost:8501")
