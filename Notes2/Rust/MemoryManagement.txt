====== MemoryManagement ======
Created Saturday 17 January 2026

=== Allocation ===
Reading memory happens almost equally fast in stack and heap, but allocation is much faster in the stack.

=== Moving (moving ownership) ===
If two pointers point to the same variable, the first pointer is invalidaded to ensure memory safety. This is called a "move".

=== Copying ===
let x = 5
let y = x  // y is a copy of x
