=== Install: ===
**Execute installer**
The installer might however create a wrong or broken path in ~/.bashrc. If it does, remove all lines about conda in it and execute the following command in a terminal:

~/<conda path>/bin/conda init bash

**To make it usable in the current shell, type:**
source ~/.bashrc
